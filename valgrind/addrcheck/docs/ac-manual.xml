  <title>Addrcheck: a lightweight memory checker</title>

<para>To use this tool, you must specify
<computeroutput>--tool=addrcheck</computeroutput> on the Valgrind
command line.</para>

<para>Note: Addrcheck does not work in Valgrind 3.1.0.  We may
reinstate it in later releases.</para>

<title>Kinds of bugs that Addrcheck can find</title>

<para>Addrcheck is a simplified version of the Memcheck tool
described in Section 3.  It is identical in every way to
Memcheck, except for one important detail: it does not do the
undefined-value checks that Memcheck does.  This means Addrcheck
is faster than Memcheck, and uses less memory.
Addrcheck can detect the following errors:</para>

<itemizedlist>
  <listitem>
    <para>Reading/writing memory after it has been free'd</para>
  </listitem>
  <listitem>
    <para>Reading/writing off the end of malloc'd blocks</para>
  </listitem>
  <listitem>
    <para>Reading/writing inappropriate areas on the stack</para>
  </listitem>
  <listitem>
    <para>Memory leaks -- where pointers to malloc'd blocks are lost
    forever</para>
  </listitem>
  <listitem>
    <para>Mismatched use of malloc/new/new [] vs free/delete/delete []</para>
  </listitem>
  <listitem>
    <para>Overlapping <computeroutput>src</computeroutput> and
    <computeroutput>dst</computeroutput> pointers in
    <computeroutput>memcpy()</computeroutput> and related
    functions</para>
  </listitem>
</itemizedlist>


<para>Rather than duplicate much of the Memcheck docs here, 
users of Addrcheck are advised to read <xref linkend="mc-manual.bugs"/>.  
Some important points:</para>

<itemizedlist>

  <listitem>
    <para>Addrcheck is exactly like Memcheck, except that all the
    value-definedness tracking machinery has been removed.
    Therefore, the Memcheck documentation which discusses
    definedess ("V-bits") is irrelevant.  The stuff on
    addressibility ("A-bits") is still relevant.</para>
  </listitem>

  <listitem>
    <para>Addrcheck accepts the same command-line flags as
    Memcheck, with the exception of ... (to be filled in).</para>
  </listitem>

  <listitem>
    <para>Like Memcheck, Addrcheck will do memory leak checking
    (internally, the same code does leak checking for both
    tools).  The only difference is how the two tools decide
    which memory locations to consider when searching for
    pointers to blocks.  Memcheck will only consider 4-byte
    aligned locations which are validly addressible and which
    hold defined values.  Addrcheck does not track definedness
    and so cannot apply the last, "defined value",
    criteria.</para>

    <para>The result is that Addrcheck's leak checker may
    "discover" pointers to blocks that Memcheck would not.  So it
    is possible that Memcheck could (correctly) conclude that a
    block is leaked, yet Addrcheck would not conclude
    that.</para>

    <para>Whether or not this has any effect in practice is
    unknown.  I suspect not, but that is mere speculation at this
    stage.</para>
  </listitem>

</itemizedlist>

<para>Addrcheck is, therefore, a fine-grained address checker.
All it really does is check each memory reference to say whether
or not that location may validly be addressed.  Addrcheck has a
memory overhead of one bit per byte of used address space.  In
contrast, Memcheck has an overhead of nine bits per byte.</para>

<para>Addrcheck is quite pleasant to use.  It's faster than
Memcheck, and the lack of valid-value checks has another side
effect: the errors it does report are relatively easy to track
down, compared to the tedious and often confusing search
sometimes needed to find the cause of uninitialised-value errors
reported by Memcheck.</para>
